I've started to create mods for game:

https://store.steampowered.com/app/1318690/shapez/


Installation:
--------------
copy the js file to your mod folder of the game ( by deault using Steam version on Linux: /home/%username%/.local/share/shapez.io/mods/ )

Uninstall of this mod:
----------------------
Some object/component/building store their current settings/state and it will be saved by the game to the savegame too. 

So before You remove this mod, please open all savegames you played with it remove all buildings/elements you have placed to the regular map or to the wire layer. Just after this you can remove the files of this module from the modfolder of this game.

If savegame cannot be loaded without this module (game sais corrupted), just install it again and finish removing the buildings, save the game and try to remove this mod again. (if no more building of this mod remains it will succeed)
