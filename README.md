I've started to create mods for game:

https://store.steampowered.com/app/1318690/shapez/


Installation:
--------------
copy the js file to your mod folder of the game ( by deault using Steam version on Linux: /home/%username%/.local/share/shapez.io/mods/ )





I've learnt it form: https://github.com/tobspr-games/shapez.io/tree/master/mod_examples
