This building will feed the quadPainter with colors.


The plan:
- 3 lines in at regular layer (R,G,B)
- 4 lines out at regular layer (mixed colors as needed, simple connect to quadPainter) 
- + "trash" out

- 4 lines in at wire layer (the sign of colors you need)
- 4 lines out at wire layer (connect to quadPainter slots to enable painting if needed)
