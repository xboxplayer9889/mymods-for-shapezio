This building will feed the quadPainter with colors.


The plan:
- 3 lines in at regular layer (R,G,B)
- 4 lines out at regular layer (mixed colors as needed, simple connect to quadPainter) 
- + "trash" out

- 4 lines in at wire layer (the sign of colors you need)
- 4 lines out at wire layer (connect to quadPainter slots to enable painting if needed)

- currently it accepts only color signs at wire layer as a color selection, maybe the colors of the bottom layer should be good as colorselection input

I think I've done this in v0.7.... :-)

-------

Thinking about:

- mixing version of feeder can mix only from rgb, but white may mixed from y/p/c & its complement color too.
- have to finalize icons in 2d and in 3d style, then add an option to this module to select which look u'd like to use
- when chaging colors, some of the conveyor belts connected to output can be full and stops next output with new set of colors until u clear the belt... maybe i could invent a beltcleaner/quadPainter input cleaner.
