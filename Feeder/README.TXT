-----------------------

This building (mod) designed to feed quadPainter with colors, but you can use it as a color splitter.

Current version: v0.6

   - there are 3 input lines at bottom (RGB) but u can connect anything to it and 1 line is enough to work well
   - 1 trash line at right, here it drops out unwanted,unneccessary items, if u don't need them add a trashbin to here
   - 4 output line available, managed by wire layer

   wirelayer:
   - 4 input at bottom, the color sign, this color will be sent out on that line, nothing if not color or no sign
   - 4 output at top, connect directly to quadPainter, it will controll the painter

   Switch building:
   Designed to handle Feeder if u haven't reached level 20 in game so u don't have access to wirelayer.
   - put down 4 from switch next to each other and put a Feeder on top of them (don't leave spaces)
   - click on switches to select the colors u'd like
   - don't forget to connect at least 1 line with the selected colors to RGB of Feeder through swithes

if u'd like to send out yellow/cyan/magenta/white u have to connect them to one of the input lines too.
