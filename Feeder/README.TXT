Current version: v0.5

   - there are 3 input lines at bottom (RGB) but u can connect anything to it and 1 line is enough to work well
   - 1 trash line at right, here it drops out unwanted,unneccessary items, if u don't need them add a trashbin to here
   - 4 output line available, managed by wire layer

   wirelayer:
   - 4 input at bottom, the color sign, this color will be sent out on that line, nothing if not color or no sign
   - 4 output at top, connect directly to quadPainter, it will controll the painter
