Image files created in GIMP using https://static.shapez.io/building-psds.zip

Some icons or parts are drawn and rendered in Blender.

To convert to base64, - as shapezio mod would like, - just use Linux commandline:
<BR><code>base64 pngfile.png -w 0 > pngfile.png.base64</code><BR>
Currently I have to insert them into js file...
